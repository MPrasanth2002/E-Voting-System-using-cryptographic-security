# E-Voting-System-using-cryptographic-security
A secure e-voting system using Kleopatra (GPG) for end-to-end encryption, ensuring 100% data confidentiality and tamper-proof vote integrity. Features real-time pie chart visualization, and is being enhanced with Digital Signatures and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for full privacy and authenticity.




# üîê E-Voting System with Cryptographic Security

## Overview
This project is a secure electronic voting platform that ensures privacy, integrity, and transparency in digital elections. Using Kleopatra (Gpg4win) for strong public-key encryption, all voter data and votes are fully encrypted. Results are displayed as real-time pie charts, preserving anonymity while enabling transparent aggregation.  

The project demonstrates practical application of cryptography concepts including *ata confidentiality, authentication, vote integrity, and verifiability. Currently, it is being enhanced with Digital Signatures for voter authentication and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for privacy-preserving vote validation.
